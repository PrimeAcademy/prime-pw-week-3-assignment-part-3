console.log('****** Part Supply *******');
// REQUIRED FEATURES

// 1. Create a variable called 'partsNeeded' with a value of the number 40 
//    & console.log the variable
console.log('1. Number of partsNeeded:');

// 2. Our company builds subterrainian roller-coasters, and we need an app
//    to track our orders for roller-coaster parts.
//    Create a variable call 'partOrders' set it to an array containing
//    the following numbers: 3, 5, -6, 0, 7, 11
console.log('2. Array of partOrders:');

// 3. Console log the value of the second item in the 'partOrders' array
console.log('3. Second partOrder is:');

// 4. The last item was added by mistake. Remove it from the 'partOrders' 
//    array & console.log the value removed.
console.log('4. Removed item:');

// 5. A delivery of 25 more parts arrived. Add the value 25 to the end of the array
console.log('5. Adding 25 to partOrders.');

// 6. Write a `for` loop that shows each value in the 'partOrders' array
//    Use a console.log formatted as follows, where x is the value from the array
//    - if it is a positive number (greater than 0), log 'Added x parts.' 
//    - if the value is 0, log 'No Change.'
//    - if the value is negative, format the log as 'Removed x parts.' 
console.log('6. Showing partOrders...');


// STRETCH GOALS
console.log('---  Stretch Goals  ---');
// 7. Rewrite the `for` loop from #6 as a `for of` loop. 
console.log('7. Showing partOrders with "for of" loop');

// 8. Business is booming! We're doubling our orders for parts every week.
// Write a `while` loop that adds twice the number of parts as was in the 
// previous order. Keep adding orders until we've passed 100 parts in an order
// -- then we'll need to consider getting a bigger loading dock!
console.log('8. Showing partOrders with "while" loop');


// 9. We're getting ready to build the largest subterrainian roller coaster ever!
//    We need to take stock of all our roller coaster parts, to see how 
//    big we can make it.
//    Write a loop to determine the total number of parts available by
//    adding up all the numbers in the 'partOrders' array.
console.log('9. Total parts available is:');
